# bresenham_in_ASM

conversion of Bresenham routine from C to Z80 ASM

Versions 1 to 3 are the same algorythm with each higher version a more optimized version of the prior

Version 4 is a different algorythm altogether which is considerbly smaller than Versions 1-3

Version 5 is the same as version 4 except is more optimized for space, now at 323 bytes
Currently working on Version 5 for additional space savings.
