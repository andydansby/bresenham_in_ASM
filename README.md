# bresenham_in_ASM

conversion of Bresenham routine from C to Z80 ASM

Versions 1 to 3 are the same algorythm with each higher version a more optimized version of the prior

Version 4 is a different algorythm altogether which is considerbly smaller than Versions 1-3

Version 5 is the same as version 4 except is the version I am currently working on to optimize, now at 335 bytes
