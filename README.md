# bresenham_in_ASM

conversion of Bresenham routine from C to Z80 ASM

Versions 1 to 3 are the same algorythm with each higher version a more optimized version of the prior

Version 1 is 491 bytes.

Version 2 is 456 bytes

Version 3 is 443 bytes


Version 4 is a different algorythm altogether which is considerbly smaller than Versions 1-3

Version 4 is 339 bytes

Version 5 is the same as version 4 except is more optimized for space, I am still working on this to find additional space savings

Version 5 is now at 323 bytes
